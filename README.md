# YIZY - Documentation First API Development Made Easy

> I love writing API documentation! — said no software developer ever.

API documentation is like abs, everybody wants them but nobody wants to put in
the time to build them.

Developers have mastered the art of dodging this chore. Some claim their code is
the documentation. Others generate docs from code comments and annotations,
crossing their fingers it stays accurate. And the brave souls who do write docs
from scratch? They’re stuck playing update every time the API changes.

Yet when using an API, every developer demands clear, up-to-date docs. Without
them, integration becomes guesswork.

This is where Yizy changes the game. Yizy is re-imagining API development by
providing a framework to help teams build API documentation, client SDKs, and a
context aware AI all at the same time.

## Yizy Doc

A structured, intuitive documentation format that’s AI and human readable. To
write an Yizy Doc, the only thing developers have to do is fill out a form in
their browser. That's right, you get code completion in this form. No more YAML
or JSON.

## Yizy Generator

Yizy’s deterministic code generators produce polished client SDKs in multiple
languages—directly in your browser. No waiting, no setup, no AI. Just plain,
consistent code generation.

## Yizy AI

Yizy’s built in AI assistant trained on your API’s specifics. Whether you want
to generate backend boilerplate code matching your team’s style, craft test
requests, or need help on the generated SDK, you can expect Yizy AI to be at
your service.
