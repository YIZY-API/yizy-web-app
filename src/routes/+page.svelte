			I find Open API Specificatoin and the surrounding toolchains frustrating to work with. There
			are a lot of new startups trying to solve existing problems surrounding Open API Spec.
			Companies like Speakeasy, Fern, and Liblab are all trying to improve developer experience
			surrounding Open API Spec. I want to take a different approach.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe the frustrations surrounding the Open API toolchain is due to how bloated Open API
			Spec is. I build JSON APIs mostly, and I need a quick and easy way to write a spec for my
			APIs, generate server request and response models as well as http clients to get end-to-end
			type safety across my services. If I can get API documentation out of this process, even
			better.
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead, doing what is supposed to be simple proves to be nearly impossible with Open API
			Spec. First, I have to struggle my way through writing the spec in YAML with no code
			completion help, and let‚Äôs face it, there are way too many fields in Open API Spec supporting
			all kinds of weird API use cases. Writing it by hand is a tedious and annoying process.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once I finally come up with a well-crafted Open API spec, I then have to wrestle my way
			through tons of ‚Äúofficial‚Äù and ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù code generators out there with varying degrees of
			Open API Spec support. ü´†
		</p>

		<p>
			I finally find a good generator only to realize the generator outputs different code depending
			on how you write your spec. Now I am tweaking the spec to get the generator to produce the
			output I want. Oops, now my changes in the spec breaks the output of another generator. At
			this point I might as well just develop the whole stack in a dynamically typed language and
			call it a day.
		</p>

		<p>
			Enough is enough. I am going to build my own tooling for Open API. Let me try parsing the spec
			first.
		</p>

		<p>I gave up within 5 minutes. Open API Spec is so open-ended it‚Äôs impossible to work with.</p>

		<p>
			Time to design a new API spec from scratch. Something more lightweight and human-friendly.
			Something tailored for code generation. Maybe it‚Äôs even time to ditch ‚Äòrestful‚Äô practices
			altogether and do everything with POST requests. I find restful practices a lot less ‚Äòrestful‚Äô
			than the name suggests. I don‚Äôt know. What do you guys think? Leave your complaints in the
			survey and let me know your pain points with Open API Spec.
